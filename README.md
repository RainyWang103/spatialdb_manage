# spatialdb_manage

Course work for HKU COMP3323: Advanced Database Systems

this repo focuses on managing spacial information in database, solving problems as follows

### storage and indexing in memory
store and indexing spatial information of dataset: [California Road Network](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm)

### standard spatial queries
shortest distance path:

*  Dijkstra's algorithm
*  A* optimization based on Dijkstra's algorithm

### top-k queries: 
* Threshold Algorithm (TA) 
* No Random Access (NRA)
